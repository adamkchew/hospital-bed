# Hospital Bed On-The-Go

Imagine an earthquake aftermath and the first response team arrives at the scene with hundreds of injured victims. How do you determine who needs immediate medical attention and what do you do with those who are waiting?

Introducing... Hospital Bed On-The-Go.

A network of portable “hospital bed” with smart lining integrated in sleeping bags monitoring heart rate and regulate body temperature. This helps determine who is in need for immediate medical attention and serves as a temporary comforter to keep victims warm while waiting for medical assistance. 

Hospital Bed-On-The-Go is [100x lighter and 20x more compact](http://www.drivemedical.com/index.php/full-electric-bariatric-bed-48-799.html) than a standard medical bed. They cost little to manufacture and since the technology is embedded in the linings, it's even cheaper to integrate with existing sleeping bags.

These liners will have an embedded battery for broadcasting GPS, heart rate, skin temperature to the closest wireless network, cellphone towers, and even a closed mesh ad-hoc network. The medical operator will also have access to view all of the patients historical heart rate / temperature changes and have the ability to remotely control thermal energy in the victim's sleeping bag.


This lining and mesh network application can be applied to other purposes such as, medical hospitals, advance mountaineering, natural disasters, and war zones.
